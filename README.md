# Customer_Segmentation_Model_using_K_Means

In this project, I learned how to implement a customer segmentation model using the K-Means clustering algorithm. This technique allows businesses to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling them to tailor their marketing strategies effectively.

Key Learnings

Understanding K-Means Clustering: I learned the fundamentals of K-Means clustering and how to apply it to group customers into distinct segments based on their similarities.
Data Preprocessing: I gained experience in preparing the dataset for analysis by performing various data preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and handling missing values.
Feature Selection: I explored different features that influence customer behavior and learned how to select the most relevant ones to improve the accuracy of the clustering results.
Model Evaluation: I applied methods like the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring that the model is both efficient and effective in capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization, helping to interpret the results clearly.
Scikit-learn: The library used to implement the K-Means algorithm and other machine learning techniques.
This project has not only solidified my technical skills but has also equipped me with practical insights into customer behavior analytics.
